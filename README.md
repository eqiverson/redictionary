# redictionary

- [x] Mdict(mdx) format
- [x] Open by shortcut, by default is `Ctrl+Shift+C`
- [x] Auto-detect clipboard

```bash
sudo apt install xsel # Required to use auto-detect clipboard
```

The dictionary hides when minimizes, and it will be shown when necessary. Tray icon might appear, I don't know.

#### Build Setup

``` bash
# install dependencies
npm install

# serve with hot reload at localhost:9080
npm run dev

# build electron application for production
npm run build


```
