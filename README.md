# redictionary

[![Build Status](https://travis-ci.com/planetoryd/redictionary.svg?branch=main)](https://travis-ci.com/planetoryd/redictionary)

- [x] Mdict(mdx) format
- [x] Open by shortcut, by default is `Ctrl+Alt+C`
- [x] Auto-detect clipboard


```bash
sudo apt install xsel # Required to use auto-detect clipboard
```

The dictionary hides when minimizes, and it will be shown when necessary. Tray icon might appear, I don't know.

yarn run build
```
